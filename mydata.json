        "Q1": "What are your main strengths? I am a hard working person who is enthusiastic about learning and continually finding ways to develop myself to reach higher levels. I am passionate about helping people and I am looking for an opportunity that allows me to continue caring for people in a pharmaceutical sector. I have enjoyed my time studying pharmacology at university and became increasingly drawn to learning about medications and their mechanisms of action in the body and their effects. I am always driven to do my best and I am very keen to ask a lot of questions to further expand my knowledge and deliver the best quality of care. As a student, I had the advantage of being supervised by multiple members of staff. Each day on the ward would be a different day so whenever I practiced a new skill, or if I was working with a member of the team I had never worked directly with before, I always asked for feedback at the end of my shift so that I could monitor my progress and build on their comments. For example, one member of the team said to improve, I should start taking my own caseload of patients during a shift, so I took that into consideration and started doing that the following shifts I had. This allowed me to become more independent and improved my communicative skills as I was able to accurately handover the patients that I had to the relevant staff members and escalate appropriately if they deteriorated. Therefore, I had to be very attentive to details. I am also very keen to make sure evevryone is treated with respect. I was able to care for a patient suffering with a mental health condition and due to some stigma on the ward surrounding mental health, this patient was often left alone and no one checked in on them unless it was to give them their medications or to do observations. This was upsetting to me as I would often see this patient looking low and had no one to sit down with them to see if they were ok. So, during my shift, rather than ignoring this patient due to fear, I sat down with this patient and treated them with respect by simply having a conversation with them. We spoke about their favourite books and about what they were learning in school. I even arranged for them to have some resources sent by the play specialists to keep them occupied if they did not have any family members with them. By having this simple interaction, I noticed a big change in this patients mood and subsequently the actions of the staff. The staff were now constantly checking in with this patient to make sure they were ok and to see if they needed anything and as a result, I witnessed this patient becoming a lot more happier and confident within themselves because they were being treated how they deserved to be treated.",
        "Q2": "What skills would you like to improve during this apprenticeship? I would love to improve my understanding of how retail pharmacies operate and how they work to get prescriptions to patients in a safe and effective manner. I would also like to improve my knowledge on how different medications work. Additionally, since I will be interacting with patients in a more local environment, I would love to use this opportunity to further develop my customer care skills.",

        "Q1": "What are your main strengths? My main strength is my communication skills. Whilst at my last college -MPW- I was both part of the student council and the debate team. I chose to join both of these extra-curricular, not only to improve my communication but to learn to be able to do so with confidence. Both of these taught me different aspects of communication. In debate team I learned the importance of speaking with clarity and doing to concisely, to quickly & effectively put across my point. Whereas on the student council I learned not to overlook the skill of being an active listener, as when issues were raised we all worked together to brainstorm a way to find a solution. During year 10 I took part in the duke of Edinburgh, which taught me both teamwork as well as organisation. In the first 6 months of the program, we had to independently organise 6 months of volunteering, 3 months of a physical activity and 3 months of learning a new skill. We then also had to fit an hour of each in every week around our school, extracurriculars and expedition prep which taught me to also be flexible to accommodate all tasks that needed to be completed. When we were on the trip at the end of the program, we had to work as a team on both days to navigate our way from the point we were dropped off at to where we were camping or the night. we also all had to pitch into help carry equipment that we'd all need to use that evening, such as cooking equipment and torches. During training, we had all worked specifically to learn a particular skill in detail, so pooling our knowledge and what we had learnt was essential for us to complete the expedition in time for us to get our duke of Edinburgh.",
        "Q2": "What skills would you like to improve during this apprenticeship? In particular, I'd like to improve my confidence & networking skill, mostly because I think these two skills are the ones I've developed the least and had the most difficulty with. As these are two key skills a successful & developed business person needs, they are my main focus. I'd also like to further develop my IT skills as I have a foundation of knowledge I'm confident in, but I'd like to confidently be able to use more specific & advance software. Having studied IT application but not really having used it much since I feel it's a waste to not want to build on the foundation I have. After the first year of my course, I aim to have a better idea of what sector I'd like to work in, but never having done business before I'd like to remain open-minded until I'm better informed. At the moment my favourite options are HR, finance and accounting, but I'm still exploring all my options.",
        "Q3": "What are your hobbies and interests? I'm an outgoing person, so most of my interests involve socialising. Most of my free time is therefore open with my friends, who all have different preferences as to how they spend their time. This makes for a very varied range of activities, in groups we go to galleries, shows, concerts and dancing. The hobby that I would say is the most therapeutic and I really use for 'me time' is reading. When I was younger I was much more introverted, until I found my group. So activities that I could do by myself were always my favourite. I spent a lot of time in the library so I got a lot of good book recommendation and fell in love from a young age and the habit just stuck. Being one of 5 kids, there were always a lot of conflicting option and point of views. So debating became like second nature, which is why I joined the debate team in college. Now, being older, I'm able to tie that to current affairs and discuss these with my friends and family, effectively combining two of my interests into one."

From the science behind the design and production of medicines to the practical role of working with patients, medical professionals and pharmaceutical companies, it is this variety that attracts me to a career in pharmacy.

I am a young and thriving individual, who is always ready to learn and work. I have great communication skills in both Spanish and English (as I am originally Colombian) making it easy for me to understand people\u2019s needs or concerns to effectively address them.

        "Q1": "What are your main strengths? I am a hard working person who is enthusiastic about learning and continually finding ways to develop myself to reach higher levels. I am passionate about helping people and I am looking for an opportunity that allows me to continue caring for people in a pharmaceutical sector. I have enjoyed my time studying pharmacology at university and became increasingly drawn to learning about medications and their mechanisms of action in the body and their effects. I am always driven to do my best and I am very keen to ask a lot of questions to further expand my knowledge and deliver the best quality of care. As a student, I had the advantage of being supervised by multiple members of staff. Each day on the ward would be a different day so whenever I practiced a new skill, or if I was working with a member of the team I had never worked directly with before, I always asked for feedback at the end of my shift so that I could monitor my progress and build on their comments. For example, one member of the team said to improve, I should start taking my own caseload of patients during a shift, so I took that into consideration and started doing that the following shifts I had. This allowed me to become more independent and improved my communicative skills as I was able to accurately handover the patients that I had to the relevant staff members and escalate appropriately if they deteriorated. Therefore, I had to be very attentive to details. I am also very keen to make sure evevryone is treated with respect. I was able to care for a patient suffering with a mental health condition and due to some stigma on the ward surrounding mental health, this patient was often left alone and no one checked in on them unless it was to give them their medications or to do observations. This was upsetting to me as I would often see this patient looking low and had no one to sit down with them to see if they were ok. So, during my shift, rather than ignoring this patient due to fear, I sat down with this patient and treated them with respect by simply having a conversation with them. We spoke about their favourite books and about what they were learning in school. I even arranged for them to have some resources sent by the play specialists to keep them occupied if they did not have any family members with them. By having this simple interaction, I noticed a big change in this patients mood and subsequently the actions of the staff. The staff were now constantly checking in with this patient to make sure they were ok and to see if they needed anything and as a result, I witnessed this patient becoming a lot more happier and confident within themselves because they were being treated how they deserved to be treated.",
        "Q2": "What skills would you like to improve during this apprenticeship? I would love to improve my understanding of how retail pharmacies operate and how they work to get prescriptions to patients in a safe and effective manner.

        "Q1": "What are your main strengths? I believe that my main strengths are great customer service skills, working with individuals from all walks of life and finally anything technology based. From a young age I have always been the \"go to guy\" when it comes to anything electronic/technical according to my family and friends. I have always had a love for technology ever since I can remember and it is demonstrated in my career history and education. Furthermore, working several years in customer service in the mobile technology industry I have demonstrated these strengths on a daily basis. A perfect example of this was a time when I gave a technical tutorial at my store (Carphone Warehouse) to a visually impaired child who came to the store with his mother and she had purchased an iPad for him but he did not know how to use the accessibility features on the tablet. It was difficult to teach him but I do love a good challenge so I took my time in telling him how to use the VoiceOver feature on his iPad. I explained how a single finger tap will highlight and read out aloud the app icon or setting he is currently on and then how double tapping will select said app icon or setting. It took a few tries for him to understand and master it. I then made sure he was self sufficient by testing him near to the end of our session asking him to find specific applications or settings and I was amazed with his ability to learn something new with such efficiency. I was also proud of myself for successfully teaching an individual who was visually impaired. Another personal example of my technical strengths was when I helped my aunt with her 2009 Apple MacBook Pro 160gb 4gb ram Core 2 Duo. At the time she had the laptop for about 4 to 5 years and it was running extremely slow, running out of storage and the track pad was not functioning properly. She was literally thinking about purchasing a new 2013 model, new at the time for about \u00a31200. I found out about this and advised her that I could easily save her about \u00a31000 if I upgraded the hardware components of her old MacBook Pro. She decided to follow my advice and I proceeded to check her upgrade options using a hardware and upgrade scanner software on her laptop. After my research, I purchased a brand new 256gb SSD for about \u00a3100 using my staff discount, I also purchased 4gb DDR ram for about \u00a325 and finally I ordered a track pad for her specific model from a reputable source for about \u00a330. Once everything arrived, I was more than confident to disassemble her MacBook Pro by removing the base plate and removing her old hard drive and one of the 4gb ram modules using specific precision screwdrivers for the job and installed the new 256gb SSD and the new 4gb ram module with ease as I have done this on various desktops and laptops over time. Installing the track pad on a MacBook Pro was new to me, however a quick Google search and YouTube tutorial on how to do this helped me to install it correctly, which I did. My aunt was pleased to say the least with the work that I carried out as the laptop according to her felt better than new due to the faster components and a fixed track pad and it gave the laptop a new lease of life and she is still using it today. Finally, I would like to add that I have great customer service skills and telephone manner which I have gained through years of retail customer service. I am keen to learn new skills and as I mentioned before I love new challenges. I have a proven experience in the I.T/Technology field and customer service in my career history and I truly believe that I would be a great asset to your team as I have various transferable skills and I'm seeking a completely new challenge . I just need to be given the opportunity to prove to myself and most importantly your organisation that I would be a great asset, team player and worthy of a great career working for Mansons Chemist as a Level 2 Pharmacy Assistant Apprentice.",
        "Q2": "What skills would you like to improve during this apprenticeship? There are various skills I would like to improve during this apprenticeship. I strongly believe that there is always something new to learn in any given situation or develop and improve on existing skills. I do have a generally good knowledge of computer hardware and software and great customer service skills. However, the pharmaceutical industry is alien to me but I do love a good challenge and also I am amazed, curious and intrigued as to how medicines work. How they help to treat and cure various ailments, diseases and general health issues. I have several years of customer service behind me but in a technical setting helping individuals from all walks of life with their technical needs. This apprenticeship will help me learn and understand a completely new industry and allow me to transfer my existing customer service skills to help \u201cfix\u201d people instead of technology. Ultimately, this apprenticeship will allow me to improve my existing customer service skills in a new setting and also allow me to learn about the pharmaceutical industry which is new to me. It will allow me to improve all of my existing skills and learn new things on the way and I believe that Manson Chemist will be the perfect place to help me achieve this as it has a great reputation for customer service and the staff are knowledgeable according to online reviews and I really want to be a part of such an organisation which takes pride in its products and services.",
        "Q3": "What are your hobbies and interests? I have several hobbies and interests which have changed over time. I have always loved gaming from a young age. I still own an original Sega Master System and Super Nintendo which I still play with, although rarely. I also own a PlayStation one, two, three, four, an Xbox 360, a Nintendo Switch and also a low tier gaming PC. I play video games every now and then and enjoy a good platform, adventure, RPG, first person shooter, sandbox and beat em ups. However, I am more into retro gaming nowadays as it reminds me of simpler times when I was more carefree. I like to visit fun fairs and theme parks as I love the arcades and amusements and also the rides and roller coasters as I consider myself to be thrill seeker. I also enjoyed studying and learning new things. I was the first student from a group of five different access to higher education classes that passed my qualification and finished college earlier than the rest. I am also the only sibling in my family to actually get into University and I am proud of this. I also love driving. I find it somewhat therapeutic at times. Obtaining my licence was one of the biggest achievements personally in recent time. I have now been driving for about six years or so with no points on my driving licence and I consider myself to be a good and most importantly safe driver. This was a great personal achievement as it enabled me to gain more independence, opened more opportunities and help the ones that I love and care about. I enjoy long drives and visiting new places with my partner such as new beaches, parks and open spaces that I have not had the chance to visit before. I love walks in the park, forests and open spaces as it enables me to be close to nature when life becomes somewhat hectic. As mentioned before, I also have a love for anything technical such as desktops computers, laptops, tablets, games consoles and any other smart devices. I try my best to keep up to date with the latest technology by visiting sites such as Currys, Ebuyer and Scan, etc and also by watching YouTube tech unboxing videos, tutorials and reviews. I am also an avid fan of documentaries, the paranormal/supernatural and conspiracy theories. I like to think outside of the box. Furthermore, when the opportunity arises, I love to go out and socialise with friends and love to meet new people from all walks of life. In contrast to the above, I also have a passion for cooking and food in general. I try to create my own recipes or follow others who inspire me on television or YouTube. Finally, I also like to read newspapers and watch the news to keep up to date with current affairs in my local area and the world in general. Finally, I love to learn new things, view different opinions and perspectives and possibly adopt new hobbies and interests if and when I meet the right individuals."

I chose to join both of these extra-curricular, not only to improve my communication but to learn to be able to do so with confidence. Both of these taught me different aspects of communication. In debate team I learned the importance of speaking with clarity and doing to concisely, to quickly & effectively put across my point. Whereas on the student council I learned not to overlook the skill of being an active listener, as when issues were raised we all worked together to brainstorm a way to find a solution. During year 10 I took part in the duke of Edinburgh, which taught me both teamwork as well as organisation. In the first 6 months of the program, we had to independently organise 6 months of volunteering, 3 months of a physical activity and 3 months of learning a new skill. We then also had to fit an hour of each in every week around our school, extracurriculars and expedition prep which taught me to also be flexible to accommodate all tasks that needed to be completed. When we were on the trip at the end of the program, we had to work as a team on both days to navigate our way from the point we were dropped off at to where we were camping or the night. we also all had to pitch into help carry equipment that we'd all need to use that evening, such as cooking equipment and torches. During training, we had all worked specifically to learn a particular skill in detail, so pooling our knowledge and what we had learnt was essential for us to complete the expedition in time for us to get our duke of Edinburgh.",
        "Q2": "What skills would you like to improve during this apprenticeship? In particular, I'd like to improve my confidence & networking skill, mostly because I think these two skills are the ones I've developed the least and had the most difficulty with. As these are two key skills a successful & developed business person needs, they are my main focus. I'd also like to further develop my IT skills as I have a foundation of knowledge I'm confident in, but I'd like to confidently be able to use more specific & advance software. Having studied IT application but not really having used it much since I feel it's a waste to not want to build on the foundation I have. After the first year of my course, I aim to have a better idea of what sector I'd like to work in, but never having done business before I'd like to remain open-minded until I'm better informed. At the moment my favourite options are HR, finance and accounting, but I'm still exploring all my options.",
        "Q3": "What are your hobbies and interests? I'm an outgoing person, so most of my interests involve socialising. Most of my free time is therefore open with my friends, who all have different preferences as to how they spend their time. This makes for a very varied range of activities, in groups we go to galleries, shows, concerts and dancing. The hobby that I would say is the most therapeutic and I really use for 'me time' is reading. When I was younger I was much more introverted, until I found my group. So activities that I could do by myself were always my favourite. I spent a lot of time in the library so I got a lot of good book recommendation and fell in love from a young age and the habit just stuck. Being one of 5 kids, there were always a lot of conflicting option and point of views. So debating became like second nature, which is why I joined the debate team in college. Now, being older, I'm able to tie that to current affairs and discuss these with my friends and family, effectively combining two of my interests into one."

I demonstrated leadership in my position as an assistant manager, providing assistance with 35 drivers, handling their problems and issues when they are out delivering and any other assistance they may need. I also presented leadership when I lead monthly team meetings with the drivers, providing essencial updates and relevant information. A final example, of many I could provide with leadership would be when I worked in the Lola\u2019s stores as a supervisor and had to take charge when my manager was away on holiday, assisting the team and taking charge of the store, completing essencial excel sheets and ensuring targets were met. Another main strength I possess is data entry, I have over 2.5 years of experience with transferring data from different spreadsheets and systems. This skill continues to expand. A final strength I will state is patience. I worked in a shopping centre which got very busy, working weekends and weekdays. I worked under pressure and in timed circumstances for example, in the role I had as a warehouse assistant having to complete orders in less than 2 minutes. I was put in many situations facing upset customers in which I was able to diffuse the situation and remain calm with the customer, even in challenging situations.",

        "Q1": "What are your main strengths? I am a hard working person who is enthusiastic about learning and continually finding ways to develop myself to reach higher levels. I am passionate about helping people and I am looking for an opportunity that allows me to continue caring for people in a pharmaceutical sector. I have enjoyed my time studying pharmacology at university and became increasingly drawn to learning about medications and their mechanisms of action in the body and their effects. I am always driven to do my best and I am very keen to ask a lot of questions to further expand my knowledge and deliver the best quality of care. As a student, I had the advantage of being supervised by multiple members of staff. Each day on the ward would be a different day so whenever I practiced a new skill, or if I was working with a member of the team I had never worked directly with before, I always asked for feedback at the end of my shift so that I could monitor my progress and build on their comments. For example, one member of the team said to improve, I should start taking my own caseload of patients during a shift, so I took that into consideration and started doing that the following shifts I had. This allowed me to become more independent and improved my communicative skills as I was able to accurately handover the patients that I had to the relevant staff members and escalate appropriately if they deteriorated. Therefore, I had to be very attentive to details. I am also very keen to make sure evevryone is treated with respect. I was able to care for a patient suffering with a mental health condition and due to some stigma on the ward surrounding mental health, this patient was often left alone and no one checked in on them unless it was to give them their medications or to do observations. This was upsetting to me as I would often see this patient looking low and had no one to sit down with them to see if they were ok. So, during my shift, rather than ignoring this patient due to fear, I sat down with this patient and treated them with respect by simply having a conversation with them. We spoke about their favourite books and about what they were learning in school. I even arranged for them to have some resources sent by the play specialists to keep them occupied if they did not have any family members with them. By having this simple interaction, I noticed a big change in this patients mood and subsequently the actions of the staff. The staff were now constantly checking in with this patient to make sure they were ok and to see if they needed anything and as a result, I witnessed this patient becoming a lot more happier and confident within themselves because they were being treated how they deserved to be treated.",

        "Q1": "What are your main strengths? I am exceptionally good at learning quick, making decesions and adapting to a new environment quickly in order to proceed in what I do for example, I started off as a footballer but was quickly able to adapt to athletics as I made the decision to put the hard work in order to succeed. I was decent at football but was not the best at athletics (long jump) so I had to learn visually and work through a new experience but 4 months later I was working at similar rates with other athletes. I demonstrated quick decesion making for my future, adaptation but also using my fast learning to my advantage. I also come from a different country and I had to adapt to the different accent and culture quickly and then learn to also use the accent aswell as also code-switch at the right times helping me to demonstrate these 3 strengths on a day to day basis.",
        "Q2": "What skills would you like to improve during this apprenticeship? In this apprenticeship i would like to improve my communication skills and my work experience. I never had official work experience but I am no stranger to the workplace. I am able to focus well on the things I do speak well and clearly to customers even in a different language if they cannot understand English well (French, Portuguese, and Galician.) I feel like I would work great behind the tills, and with customer assistance. I can work well with putting up the different stocks too. I believe it can help me learn along the way too with my health and the different ways I could treat myself or family members if they become sick or feel a way. My general knowledge can improve and the way I speak too. Overall I believe this apprentice is a good thing for me and can help me improve drastically.",
        "Q3": "What are your hobbies and interests? I am very into fashion, music, hair/beauty care, animals and sports. I used to play football when I was younger and also used to box as I won 2 medals and a trophy from football and 6 medals and a trophy from boxing. I am very into clothing brands such as Nike, Addidas, Puma, Jack & Jones and Comme Des Garcons I buy them very often. I am into all kinds of music such as rap, hip-hop, afrobeats, bashment, country music and much more. I belive music does a lot of healing for the mind and body and it is a special part of every culture out there. I like to take time out my day to study animals such as big cats and wild cats, primates, dogs and marine wildlife. I found an interest at it at the age of 6 when I got my first book about snow leopards. At 8 I went to the zoo and I saw a snow leopard and an Indian dhole so from then I started to learn more about different mammals and even won a animal quiz competition twice at the age of 9 years old and 12 years old. I like to make people feel happy and great about themselves as people, this include the children as I would often include everyone when I was younger. In my free time I take some time to speak to my little cousins and family friends about how they feel and what they want to do/achieve. I would play football with them or play games so they could feel included and accepted."

Often speaking with customers that range from the younger generation that are often bargain shopping to the more maturer customers, who along with shopping will often come in for a chat as some are alone with no family or friends and see the charity shop as socialising hub as well as a shopping experience. Willingness To Learn - I am a very flexible individual who acknowledges that my lack of actual work experience puts me at the bottom of the professional ladder and it is one that I look forward to climbing .I will learn new things and excel in whatever has been show/taught to me. I proved this at my time at the Co-Op when having worked for the first time in my life, I quickly learned the process of taking in and distributing new stock, resulting in the Co-Op offering me a summer job. Time Keeping - I have never been late on any of my school/college/work experience placements. I believe it is better to be half an hour early then one minute late.

I have also completed work experience with the London Ambulance Service, where I was able to shadow paramedics and come into contact with casualties who were experiencing a variety of health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, heart failure and stroke.

        "Q1": "What are your main strengths? I showcase my strength of problem solving skills in many sectors of my life. One example is when I improved the performance of my computer. My computer was running quite poorly and I wanted to improve the efficiency of it. This lead me to do some research in products that would increase the processing speeds of my computer; such as an increase in RAM or a larger SSD. I identified that the problem was a below average RAM , with only an 8GB capacity. I solved this issue by purchasing 24GB extra RAM sticks, boosting my total RAM capacity to 32GB. By using my problem solving skills, I also used skills in attention to detail and improved my ability to research problems and how they can be solved in depth. An example of my skills in team work was when me and my team had to organise a presentation for our history assignment. This was a task that was expected to be challenging for all groups. However, my team had a key skill that was needed for the best outcome; team work. We each were assigned different roles to more easily manage the work load that we had. I was on research with another member of the group, one person was in charge of writing a script for our presentation and, finally, we had one person working on the actual power point with our final ideas. Understanding that the assignment was not as easy to complete without understanding your team members, allowed us to complete the task efficiently with some time to spare.",

        "Q1": "What are your main strengths? On the outset of many socio-developmental programmes and other initiatives I was able to show that I am an already effective communicator who can only keep growing. The following is evident as I strived to continue communication despite lack of responses within groups of people I have found myself with whether working on projects or presentations. In addition I was coached to develop myself and delivered presentation to stakeholders with confidence. During my time as a volunteer retail assistant I was a strong effective front of the business many customers would come to me as in the middle of doing many jobs I made myself always very clearly visible this is important as in being pharmacist it is important I can make people at ease or simply appearing approachable to be able to come with their queries. No matter if in school or as a part of project, activity within socio-developmental programmes- I would be always effectively be able to mould myself with others and other people as part of a team. During one programme Spear there was varied interest in participation but through my personable, amicable attitude and having strong confidence in myself I was able to strongly drive the engagement, participation within many personalities that would find themselves in different very familiar groups and also meeting towards the end groups we have no original familiarity with and still be able to feel that they belong and fit right in. In addition I take great deal of care to be fit which means I do not only exercise 1 to few days a week but also walk long distances on average from 3 to 5 miles and occasionaly longer. This will mean that I will be able to effectively move about within and around the pharmacy if necessary and be able to remain active and standing up even if sat down a lot. Finally I am very patient having supported a Care Home working with vulnerable people I learn to wait and listen and appreciation that some people may find it difficult to formulate themselves and also have knowledge of Health and Safety, customer service as result of learning in Traineeship at LLC undertaken within both Health and Safety as well as Customer Service units.",

        "Q1": "What are your main strengths? I am a hard working person who is enthusiastic about learning and continually finding ways to develop myself to reach higher levels. I am passionate about helping people and I am looking for an opportunity that allows me to continue caring for people in a pharmaceutical sector. I have enjoyed my time studying pharmacology at university and became increasingly drawn to learning about medications and their mechanisms of action in the body and their effects. I am always driven to do my best and I am very keen to ask a lot of questions to further expand my knowledge and deliver the best quality of care. As a student, I had the advantage of being supervised by multiple members of staff. Each day on the ward would be a different day so whenever I practiced a new skill, or if I was working with a member of the team I had never worked directly with before, I always asked for feedback at the end of my shift so that I could monitor my progress and build on their comments. For example, one member of the team said to improve, I should start taking my own caseload of patients during a shift, so I took that into consideration and started doing that the following shifts I had. This allowed me to become more independent and improved my communicative skills as I was able to accurately handover the patients that I had to the relevant staff members and escalate appropriately if they deteriorated. Therefore, I had to be very attentive to details. I am also very keen to make sure evevryone is treated with respect. I was able to care for a patient suffering with a mental health condition and due to some stigma on the ward surrounding mental health, this patient was often left alone and no one checked in on them unless it was to give them their medications or to do observations. This was upsetting to me as I would often see this patient looking low and had no one to sit down with them to see if they were ok. So, during my shift, rather than ignoring this patient due to fear, I sat down with this patient and treated them with respect by simply having a conversation with them. We spoke about their favourite books and about what they were learning in school. I even arranged for them to have some resources sent by the play specialists to keep them occupied if they did not have any family members with them. By having this simple interaction, I noticed a big change in this patients mood and subsequently the actions of the staff. The staff were now constantly checking in with this patient to make sure they were ok and to see if they needed anything and as a result, I witnessed this patient becoming a lot more happier and confident within themselves because they were being treated how they deserved to be treated.",

        "Q1": "What are your main strengths? One of my strengths is my flexibility to handle change for example I had to plan a presentation for school on short notice and I was able to not only plan it but organise it in a way that was time effective and productive, furthermore, this allows me to work well under pressure and delegate a sudden increase in work. I am also respectful to all people, as I understand that it allows everyone to feel valued and appreciated and reduces conflicts. Respecting views and not being prejudiced is very important to form better connections and understanding. One of my greatest strengths is my ability to be a well-organised individual, this allows me to complete tasks when they need to be completed and reach my goals and not get distracted by anything else. For instance, I create to-do lists and memos to remind me of deadlines and outstanding work. Furthermore, I am a quick learner which enables me to grasp new concepts quickly so I can adapt and constantly improve. I am a determined person which allows me to always finish what I am doing and reach all the goals that I set. I try to create realistic goals which are achievable and manageable to not overwhelm myself. I am a confident person as I can express my own opinions and acknowledge my own achievements and efforts. Being confident helps me to take advantage of new opportunities to further improve my skill set. I am a responsible person, as I can own up to my mistakes and correct them so that I can make better decisions and improve my integrity.",
        "Q2": "What skills would you like to improve during this apprenticeship? I would like to improve my communication skills and be able to talk to patients and understand their needs and wants and take them into consideration. Communication skills also apply to talking to staff members and colleagues. This is a skill that I have started to gain by talking to health professionals such as doctors and teachers. I have to be able to communicate effectively with patients, dental hygienists, dental assistants, and receptionists to avoid miscommunication that could harm a patient. I would like to improve my accuracy as dental nurse assistant practitioners must be detail-oriented so patients receive the correct treatments and medications. Furthermore, I need to learn how to have physical stamina as assistance and nurses should be comfortable working long hours and long periods of time as they need to bend over to see the patient laying down. I would like to become more resilient during this apprenticeship, as mistakes and obstacles affect me and I would like to learn from them and keep trying till I become better, I believe overcoming hurdles and obstacles will make me a more passionate and determined individual and improve my work ethic.",
        "Q3": "What are your hobbies and interests? I really like cooking as I enjoy making different healthy meals as well as exploring new tastes and foods from different cultures. Cooking can also improve my mood as the feeling of satisfaction I gain when I see the end product naturally enhances my happiness. I like to bake cakes, cookies and desserts as I love the look on someone\u2019s face when I present them with something I\u2019ve made and the look they have when they take that first bite. Watching movies and films is another hobby of mine as I enjoy experiencing and watching the different emotions and following the storylines to see what happens next. The roller-coaster of emotions and predicting plots excite me and refreshes my mind at the same time. It allows me a break from hectic school life. Watching movies can be done with families and friends which make it an even better experience. Furthermore, I also like playing some video games as it allows you to experience excitement and danger from the safety of your chair. I enjoy playing video games as it gives me the opportunity to do things, I would never be able to do in real life it also helps improve my creativity and focus. In addition to my hobbies, I also enjoy swimming as it calms me down and I feel relaxed. I feel weightless in the water as I float which makes me feel relaxed. It is also a multi-tiered sport as you can swim any way you want; it can be competitive or just for yourself."

I played my part in the team and in the tasks we had to carryout, involving others, respecting their thoughts and opinions and ensuring the best was brought out of everyone. As a result we were able to work positively together to achieve the tasks without any one person taking on all the burden. When working at White Swan Garage Ltd, I worked hard to support the team with cleaning and serving customers. Third, I am good at following procedures and listening to instructions and can apply this skill to following business and company procedures. At White Swan Garage Ltd, I had to follow health and safety procedures and follow instructions in relation to working with the cars, cleaning in the shop, and how to speak to customers. Fourth, I have strong IT and administration skills which I developed throughout my time in school, in my personal life and at college. In my BTEC Business Level 2 course at West Thames College I gained an in depth knowledge of Excel, Word, MS Teams, PowerPoint and MS Office overall. In school, I also gained knowledge and experience of MS Office. Fifth, I have strong organisational skills. When I was in school and college I always organised the equipment and books I needed for class the day before, ensuring I was prepared for class and arrived to school and college on time. I also organised my time well and planned ahead to ensure I met longer term coursework deadlines for bigger assignments, in addition to daily and short term deadlines. When I had presentations in school, I ensured I was well organised and prepared for the presentation, so that the presentation went well. When carrying out projects in school I led the team in carrying out the projects in the most efficient way possible by planning ahead, organising the work and assigning responsibilities based on the teams' strengths. Sixth, I have good customer care skills. When working at White Swan Garage Ltd I received excellent feedback from my managers and the customers regarding how responsive I was to them, their needs and questions. I am a very polite person and got along well with customers and colleagues at At White Swan Garage Ltd. I was able to remain calm and be polite even if the customers were expressing frustration or complaining. I always sought to resolve their problems and seek a resolution. I also always got on well with my peers and teachers in school. I am always polite with all people, regardless their background. Finally, I always seek to take initiative and I can be trusted with varying levels of work and responsibility. This is something I demonstrated in school, college and at White Swan Garage. If I see something that needs to be done, I will deal with it.",

The skills and knowledge I gained from the work placement have helped me to become more organised and enabled me to become more independent and not always be reliant on other people to accomplish tasks. I have also completed work experience with the London Ambulance Service, where I was able to shadow paramedics and come into contact with casualties who were experiencing a variety of health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, heart failure and stroke. Seeing first-hand how paramedics dealt with patients calmly and collectively was an eye-opening experience which enabled me to grasp crucial skills such as empathy, patient-centred care and working under pressure.",

This will allow me to provide patient-centred care and advise patients and ensure that they have an enhanced understanding of their medication.",
        "Q3": "What are your hobbies and interests?

All of which are vital skills that are required as a pharmacy technician. During my time in school, I regularly coordinated charity fundraisers and helped raise money for several charities. Knowing that I am helping people who are less fortunate than me and that I am able to contribute and play my part however small it may be, fills me with pride and offers a sense of self-fulfilment."

Watching movies can be done with families and friends which make it an even better experience.

I also have an interest in properties as i find the real estate trade very interesting and it is definitely something i aspire to do when i am older which is why i think this apprenticeship would be very beneficial for me."

I see myself as a perfection, which I feel serves as a double edged sword for me, while it does mean I carry out my duties with great attention to detail, it does mean that I can sometimes reserve a bit too much time on a particular or even feel left dissatisfied with my work even if it meets the requirements that were given to me. Other skills of mine include time management and organisation, though I'm embarrassed to admit that these are also areas in which I can heavily improve, given the fact that my ability to perform well in my ability to mange my time and organise rely heavily on my mood, while it doesn't affect my other skills as much, it happens to be a hurdle in these two particular areas.",

I have a passion for visual media as well, not solely for the purpose of mindless consumption, but more in line with my passion for humanities and trying to grasp an understanding of basic human concepts through the arts. I've also taken an interest in psychology, which has developed from my already existing passion for humanities. I've been watching seminars reading scholarly articles and journals as well as book and have also been taking a free online course in order to further develop my knowledge of the area."

For example, knowing which orders are new and old and who they are for, were very key knowledge which sticks to me this day no matter what field I am in. As well as communicating with different members of staff to know time allocations and the current status of the food process, in order to make sure everyone was keeping on track and no few or extra was made in process. Another key strength of mine is administrative skills. Being able to book patients in, taking in orders, allocating different time slots best suited to both the customer and staff member.

        "Q2": "What skills would you like to improve during this apprenticeship? All of these skills I \u201clearned in College\u201d. I made lots of mistakes and got lots of things wrong. My tuition meant I was taught brilliantly to be a technically proficient Accountant and then had to figure the rest out on my own. I know that most other accounting professionals of my generation feel the same. I am really envious of the Apprentices that we now train. They are not just learning how to be technically great, but they are also learning the skills and behaviors that I had to figure out for myself over the last 20 years. The comprehensive Apprenticeship Standards are going to help shape the future",

I am the captain of my local football team 'Ball Hornets' and I constantly have to be confident and constantly communicate with my team members. I always lead by example, I make my teammates see me with respect. If I tell everyone what they have to do, but I don't do it, then automatically they will not see me as a responsible captain, instead, they will start seeing me as a joke. When I lead by example, it lets everybody know that we are all working together as a team to achieve that common goal: winning the game. I'm incredibly organized, something I take pride in. This makes it easier for me to stay on schedule, get to where I need to go, and be ready for any problems that may arise throughout the day. My parents instilled in me the worth of others and their time from a young age, and they taught me that being dependable was a symptom of that. To be as trustworthy as I can be, I have worked continuously both during my time in school and during my previous workplace. I very rarely miss appointments or call in ill, and I always make an effort to let people know about any issues that would jeopardise my dependability. When I worked as a waiter at Pizza Hut, I frequently observed chefs not following the correct procedures for handling safe food. I, therefore, sought to teach them the proper processes in a diplomatic manner. I also went to the manager and asked if we could put in place a mentoring program that would help everyone brush up on the best practices for handling food and maintaining a clean kitchen.",
